# **Inverted Pendulum Control With PID**
This project aims to control an inverted pendulum system using a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller implemented in MATLAB Simulink with Simspace. The inverted pendulum is a classic problem frequently used in control systems and robotics. This study focuses on designing and implementing a PID controller to stabilize the inverted pendulum system.

## **Project Structure**
_**This repository contains the following files and folders:**_

**inverted_pendulum_modelling.slx:**  Contains the Simulink model of the inverted pendulum system.

**pid_control.slx:**  Contains the Simulink model for tuning the PID controller parameters.

**pid.mp4:** Demonstrates the operation of the system. 

## **Usage** 
_**After downloading the project files, follow these steps to run the Simulink model and adjust the PID controller parameters:**_

**1 -** Open the pid_control.slx file in MATLAB Simulink.

**2 -** Set the simulation stop time to 30.

**3 -** Select the simulation type as fixed-step and choose ode4 (Runge-Kutta) as the solver.

**4 -** Set the fixed-step size to 1/1000.

**5 -** Start the simulation and observe the system response.

**6 -** Review the simulation results using scopes and mechanics explorers.
